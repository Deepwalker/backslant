Backslant
=========

Is a template engine built in completely other way then before.

First - you can use all python and more - you must use it if you want somwthing more
then just tags.

Second - it completely iterative. You can feed iterators or generators as input and get iterative output.

Third - it works through imports. If you want to get template just import it and use. If you want include
other template - import it. If you want template in some dir, import it! Like ```from . import other_template```.

So, with this principles in mind, you can try this proof of concept thing, due it is not complete:

    import backslant

    sys.meta_path.insert(0, backslant.PymlFinder('./templates', hook='backslant_import'))
    from backslant_import.home import index

    for chunk in index.render(title='The Real Thing'):
        print(chunk)

And templates/home/index.bs:

    html
        head
            title
                - yield options['title']
        body
            div.content#content
                h1#header
                    "Header"

You can define a function:

    - def render_form(method):
        form method=method
            input type="text" value="123"

End call it:

    h1
        - yield from render_form('POST')

Yes, its this simple, you just use python constructions. And for now inheritance of templates
you can made just with function.

base.bs:

    !doctype/ html
    html
    head
        title
            " Page Title
    body
        h1 {'class': ' '.join(['main', 'content'], 'ng-app': 'Application')
            " Page Header
        div.content
            - yield from options['content_func']
        div.footer
            " Backslant Â© 2015

index.bs:

    - from . import base
    - def content():
        - for i in range(10):
            p
                - yield 'Paragraph {}'.format(i)
    - yield from base.render(content_func=content)

I think about adding something like ruby blocks or something to made this a bit more simpler, but
what can be simple then functions define and call?

Arguments - you can use arg=`parentised python expression or variable name` or `tag.class {'a': 5, 'b': ' '.join(options.classes)}` form.

We have complete examples with flask and http.server in examples folder. And you can compare perfomance with jinja2. Its almost equal.

I will complete feture set soon, stay tuned.
